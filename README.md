### Does the code work? If not, what's broken?

The code does work but only after I had to add a `export default` that ChatGPT forgot to include.

### How is the code better than what the team currently has?

I don't think the code is better than what the team currently has.

### How is the code worse?

The file structure is unorganized.

### How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

It only took 1 try to get the code. I felt like the biggest struggle I faced was finding the best prompt I could give to ChatGPT.

### Overall impression of the experience

I think GenAI is definitely useful but I wouldn't use it to code up an entire project.
