# GROOOOOOOOPER

This was the prompt I gave to ChatGPT

> Create a React app (using functional components) that allows a Agile team to view current members, add or remove members, and to group members into subswarms/subgroups such that the members within the same group have not worked much with each other in the past.

ChatGPT did produce an app that worked and fulfilled the needs I specified in the prompt. The app allowed you to add and remove team members. Based off of those team members, you could click a button to regroup members. While I specified to group members based off time worked with each other, ChatGPT decided to just pair members up.

### Does the code work? If not, what's broken?

The code does work but only after I had to add a `export default` that ChatGPT forgot to include.

### How is the code better than what the team currently has?

I don't think the code is better than what the team currently has.

### How is the code worse?

The file structure is unorganized.

### How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

It only took 1 try to get the code. I felt like the biggest struggle I faced was finding the best prompt I could give to ChatGPT.

### Overall impression of the experience

I think GenAI is definitely useful but I wouldn't use it to code up an entire project.
